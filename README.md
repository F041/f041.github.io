renamed template as lowercase_username.github.io. Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment -> Source ->GitHub Actions
for config.yml edit, or stuff like uploading assets, logo, I use codescpaces, from Code (green button) ->Codespaces

when doing posts, do not trust the date format, enforce time zone even though you specified it in the _config...
add math: true when creating articles with math notation. Good luck with markdown
